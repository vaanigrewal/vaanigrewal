        <h1>Donuts!</h1>
        <b>Did somebody say donuts?</b>
<br><br>
These Baked Cinnamon Sugar Donuts are one of the easiest and tastiest recipes ever.Donuts are a very delish treat to enjoy with friends and family! donuts come in all shapes and sizes, theirs the orginals, then the filled (which can be custard, cream or sauces). On this website im going to show you a classical cinnamon and sugar donut recipe.<br><br>
1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour 
<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder
<br>1/4 teaspoon baking soda
<br>1/2 teaspoon salt
<br>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
<br>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
<br>1 large egg, at room temperature
<br> 1/3 cup (65g) packed light brown sugar
<br>1/4 cup (60ml) milk
<br> 1/4 cup (60g) yogurt
<br>2 Tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter, melted
<br>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
        <br><br><br><br>
    The recipe is quite standard. Flour, egg, butter, sugar, milk. I like to add yogurt to my donut batter for a little extra moisture. Likewise, I prefer to use brown sugar instead of granulated for moisture and a flavor boost. One of my favorite additions to this donut batter is nutmeg. Now, it sounds a little strange and out of place, but I swear by it. It truly gives these donuts that special “bakery” flavor.

        <h1> Instructions!</h1>
        <br>1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray a donut pan with non-stick spray. Set aside.
<br><br>2. Make the donuts: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl. Set aside. Whisk the egg, brown sugar, milk, and yogurt together until smooth. Add the melted butter and vanilla, whisking until fully combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not overmix. The batter will be very thick.
<br><br>3. Spoon the batter into the donut cavities—I highly recommend using a large zipped-top bag for ease. Cut a corner off the bottom of the bag and pipe the batter into each donut cup, filling 2 /3 –3 /4 of the way full.
<br><br>4. Bake for 9–10 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Allow to cool for about two minutes and transfer to a wire rack set on a large piece of parchment paper or on a large baking sheet. Bake the remaining donut batter (there is usually enough batter for 1-2 more donuts) and once baked, transfer to the wire rack. Allow donuts to cool down until you can handle them.

<br><br>5. Top the donuts: Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Dip the donuts in the melted butter, then dunk into the cinnamon sugar mixture coating all sides. Donuts are best served immediately. Leftovers keep well covered tightly at room temperature for up to 2 days.
        
        <h1> History Lesson Of The Day</h1>
        <br>
        Heres the history of the doughnut, the first donut machine didnt come out until the 1920s, in New York City, when Adolph Levitt, an enterprising refugee from czarist Russia, began selling fried doughnuts from his bakery. Hungry theater crowds pushed him to make a gadget that churned out the tasty rings faster.
        <br><br>
        To go even further back to the mid-19th century, Elizabeth Gregory, a New England ship captain's mother made a wicked deep-fried dough that cleverly used her son's spice cargo of nutmeg and cinnamon, along with lemon rind. Some say she made it so son Hanson and his crew could store a pastry on long voyages, one that might help ward off scurvy and colds. In any case, Mrs. Gregory put hazelnuts or walnuts in the center, where the dough might not cook through, and in a literal-minded way called them doughnuts.
